| Question | Answer |
| -------- | ------ |
| What is descriptive statistics? | Describing and summarizing data using tabular, visual and quatitative techniques. |
| What is a relative frequency distribution? | The frequency of each category is expressed as a fraction of the whole. |
| What is a cumulative relative frequency distribution? | An ordered relative frequency distribution. Each group expresses the fraction of the whole at or below the upper limit of the group. |
| What is a histogram? | Like a bar chart but represents the distribution of numerical values. Each bar groups numbers into ranges. Bar charts are for categorical variables, histograms are for quantitative variables. |
| What are percentiles? | The kth percentile is the sample at or above k% of other samples. `rank = nk/100 + 0.5` where `k`is the percentile. |
| What are quartiles? | Split the values into four quarters. The 25th percentile is the first quartile (Q1). The 50th percentile is the second quartile and so on. One-fourth of observations fall below the first quartile. |
