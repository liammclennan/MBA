### Types of Analytics

* **Descriptive analytics** use data to understand the past and present and to support decisions. i.e. reporting. Revenue by month. 
* **Discovery analytics** exploring data to find interesting insights.
* **Predictive Analytics** use data to predict the future. E.g. will this complaint escalate to the ombudsman. Will this loan default? What will be the profit on this engagement?
* **Prescriptive Analytics** use optimizations to maximize or minimize some value. E.g. Evaluating a load application. What is most profitable way to cut a cow? What pricing will maximize profit?

Abstraction that captures the most important features of a system and presents them in a form that is easy to interpret. 

Models may be descriptive, predictive or prescriptive (depending upon the output). 

A model is often a function that links some set of input variables to an output variable. 

A **Decision Model** is a model used to help make decisions. It may have three types of input:

1. Data (constants)
1. Uncontrollable variables (the weather, stock prices)
1. Decision variables. Controllable. (pricing, production quantities)

#### Prescriptive decision model

A prescriptive decision model helps decision makers to identify the best solution to a decision problem.

The **objective function** optimizes a variable of interest from a set of decision variables. I.e. Finds the maximum profit (**optimal solution**) value from the inputs price and quality. 

**Search algorithm** Algorithm that finds an approximate solution (model function) without guarantees of finding the best one. 

**Deterministic model** model in which all inputs are known.

**Stochastic model** model in which some inputs are uncertain (expressed as a frequency distribution). Weather models are stochastic.

**Operations Research** the analysis and solution of complex decision problems. Comes from military optimization efforts in WWII. E.g. where should be put the armour on the planes?
