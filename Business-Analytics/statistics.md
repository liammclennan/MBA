Statistics
==========

| question | answer |
| ----- | ------ |
| What is statistics? | the practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample. |
| What is a statistic? | a fact or piece of data obtained from a study of a sample of numeric data |
| What is a parameter? | a fact or datum obtained from a study of a population |  
| What symbol commonly represents the population? | N |
| What symbol commonly represents the sample? | n |
| What is a population? | A collection of all items of interest to our study |
| What is a sample? | A subset of a population |
| What is a variable? | A variable is any value that can be measured and whose value varies through the population. |
| What are the levels of measurement? | Nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio |
| What is a nominal variable? | Straight up category. E.g. Type of coffee |
| What is an ordinal variable? | Categorical variable with implied order. E.g. Size of coffee |
| What is an interval variable? | Quantitative variable where difference between values in meaningful and where ratios do not make sense. Arbitrary zero. E.g. temperature in celcius. Year. |
| What is a ratio variable? | Quantitative variable where there is a meaningful zero and where ratios make sense. E.g. temperature in Kelvin. Height. |
| What is the midrange of a variable? | The average of the highest and lowest values |
| What is the interquartile range (IQR)? | The difference between the first and the third quartiles. Q3 - Q1. I.e. the middle 50% |
| What is variance? | Average of the squared deviations from the mean |
| What is standard deviation? | Square root of the variance |
| What is a standardised value (z-score)? | a relative measure of the distance an observation is from the mean, which is independent of the units of measurement, expressed in standard deviations. A z-score of 1.0 means the observation is one standard deviation greater than the mean. |
| What is the coefficient of variation (CV)? | Standard deviation divided by the mean. Allows comparison of relative variance between different samples. E.g. stock prices. Sometimes expresses risk. |
| A positively (right) skewed distribution... | Tails off to the right |
| A negatively (left) skewed distribution... | Tails off to the left |
| The coefficient of skewness (CS) is... | Negative for negatively (left) skewed distribution. Positive for positively (right) skewed distribution. < 0.5 means low skewness. > 1 means high skewness. | 

Sampling

| question | answer |
| ----- | ------ |
| What is convenience sampling? | Taking the sample that is easiest to get. |
| What is systematic sampling? | Start at a random point and take objects a certain number apart. |
| What is cluster sampling | Random sampling within clusters. Used when the sampling frame is not available. |
| What is stratified sampling | Random sampling within strata. Strata are chosen for representation. |
